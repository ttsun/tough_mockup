                TOUGH: Suite of Simulators for Nonisothermal Multiphase Flow and Transport in Fractured Porous Media
            </p>
            <p>
                The TOUGH ("Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat") suite of software codes are multi-dimensional numerical models for simulating the coupled transport of water, vapor, non-condensible gas, and heat in porous and fractured media. Developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in the early 1980s primarily for geothermal reservoir engineering, the suite of simulators is now widely used at universities, government organizations, and private industry for applications to nuclear waste disposal, environmental remediation problems, energy production from geothermal, oil and gas reservoirs as well as gas hydrate deposits, geological carbon sequestration, vadose zone hydrology, and other uses that involve coupled thermal, hydrological, geochemical, and mechanical processes in permeable media. The TOUGH suite of simulators is continually updated, with new equation-of-state (EOS) modules being developed, and refined process descriptions implemented into the TOUGH framework (see the overview of the TOUGH development history). Notably, EOS property modules for mixtures of water, NaCl, and CO2 has been developed and is widely used for the analysis of geologic carbon sequestration processes.

                Karsten Pruess was presented a Lifetime Achievement Award for Development of the TOUGH Codes on Tuesday, September 18th at the 2012 TOUGH Symposium in Berkeley, CA.
